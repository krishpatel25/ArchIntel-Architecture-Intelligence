      "title": "Disentangling the exchange coupling of entangled donors in the Si\n  quantum computer architecture",
      "summary": "We develop a theory for micro-Raman scattering by single and coupled\ntwo-donor states in silicon. We find the Raman spectra to have significant\ndependence on the donor exchange splitting and the relative spatial positions\nof the two donor sites. In particular, we establish a strong correlation\nbetween the temperature dependence of the Raman peak intensity and the\ninterdonor exchange coupling. Micro-Raman scattering can therefore potentially\nbecome a powerful tool to measure interqubit coupling in the development of a\nSi quantum computer architecture.",

      "summary": "Single Electron Transistors (SETs) are nanoscale electrometers of\nunprecedented sensitivity, and as such have been proposed as read-out devices\nin a number of quantum computer architectures. We show that the functionality\nof a standard SET can be multiplexed so as to operate as both read-out device\nand control gate for a solid-state qubit. Multiplexing in this way may be\ncritical in lowering overall gate densities in scalable quantum computer\narchitectures.",

      "title": "Strain effects on silicon donor exchange: Quantum computer architecture\n  considerations",
      "summary": "Proposed Silicon-based quantum computer architectures have attracted\nattention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for\nsynergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing\ninfrastructure of the powerful Si technology. Quantitative understanding of and\nprecise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial\nelements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer\nhardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley\ninterference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge\ncauses fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant\nconstraints on the Si quantum computer architecture. In this paper we consider\nthe effect of external strain on Si donor exchange in the context of quantum\ncomputer hardware. We study donor electron exchange in uniaxially strained Si,\nsince strain partially lifts the valley degeneracy in the bulk. In particular,\nwe focus on the effects of donor displacements among lattice sites on the\nexchange coupling, investigating whether inter-valley interference poses less\nof a problem to exchange coupling of donors in strained Si. We show, using the\nKohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, that fast oscillations in exchange\ncoupling indeed disappear for donor pairs that satisfy certain conditions for\ntheir relative positions, while in other situations the donor exchange coupling\nremains oscillatory, with periods close to interatomic spacing. We also comment\non the possible role of controlled external strain in the design and\nfabrication of Si quantum computer architecture.",

      "summary": "We propose a modular quantum computation architecture based on utilizing\nmultipartite entanglement. Each module consists of a small-scale quantum\ncomputer comprising data, memory and entangling qubits. Entangling qubits are\nused to selectively couple different modules by harnessing some\nnon-controllable, distance-dependent interaction, which is effectively\ncontrolled and enhanced via a proper adjusting of the internal state of the\nqubits.
